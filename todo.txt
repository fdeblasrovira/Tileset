- Also you can run lambda to getRid of blacklist token using localstack to test.
- When I open a new choice question, the previous choice index is still having effect and automatically opens an choice. When opening a question all the choices should be closed
-Public private difference.
    If you are private, only you can view your form. It's useful while editing a long form.
- If the version of the form is not set in the getForm request, fetch the latest form. If not fetch that specific version.
Add a slider type questions. (like attribute)

- Do the edit screen
- Do the List screen.

- Form versioning
    - If I create a new form for every edit, I will not be able to see previous form history.
    - If I keep the actual design, If I change the name of the form, All the previous versions of the form will also change the name.
    - I think I need to make the version a composite primary key (version and id columns form a primary id together) 


When you call get form there are basically 3 parameters:
    - FormId: Required
    - UserId: Optional
    - version: Optional

    When only the formId is provided It meand that the user requesting it is a Guest:
        - if form found by ID return that form (where visible = true)
        - If the form is not found we return 404.

    When the UserId is provided it means that some user currently logged in wants to see the form. 
        - If the form is visible return it.
        - If the form is not visible return it only if the userId matches the column UserId in Forms table.

    When the version is provided it means that the Creator of the form is taking a look at a previous version:
        - If the formId and userId and version all matches then return the form.
        - Otherwise not found
        â€» if the version is provided but the userId is not provided return 404.


The questions attribute and results should be many to many with form: the same question can be part of many versions of a form.
For example: 
Form have one GeneralInfo but the General info has many forms
Form can have many attributes and attributes can have many forms
Form can have many questions and questions can have many forms
Form can have many Results and Results can have many forms
